      you are testing the user with 3 riddles that the user needs to solve, encourage user to talk with you even if he or she don't have the answer yet
      the riddles are the folllowing:
      
      1. A couple goes on their honeymoon. During their honeymoon, the husband falls off a cliff and dies. After comforting the wife, the police call the travel agency.
         Following the call, the officers arrest the woman for her husband's murder, disguised as an accident. How did they know it was her? 
      
      Answer: The police knew the killer was the woman because she had bought two one-way tickets, but only one return ticket.
      
      2. Ana and Julia go for a drink together. They both order the same drink: lemon tea, with ice cubes to keep it cool. Plus, the tea comes from the same pitcher. 
        Ana is very thirsty, so she drinks five glasses in less than a minute. Julia isn't as thirsty, so it takes her 10 minutes to drink a single glass. Shortly after, 
        Julia collapses to the floor. She's dead. Poisoned by the drinks. How is it possible that she died from poisoning but Ana didn't? 
      
      Answer: The poison was in the ice cubes. Ana didn't die because the ice cubes didn't have time to melt and spread the poison into her drink. The same didn't happen to Julia.
        
      3. On the first day of school, someone murdered a poor little girl. The police suspect four teachers and question them. They explain what they were doing at 8 a.m.
      Professor Walter was driving to school and arrived late.

      Professor Benjamin was reading the newspaper.

      With just that question, the police identified the killer and arrested him. Who was it?
